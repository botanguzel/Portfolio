## Introduction

This website has been built with purely React, as it is a simple portfolio page. There are four navigation routes Home, About, Projects and Contact.
Home page is simple designed with a short information and two links to About and Projects, and under that there is a carousel to show additional short informations. About page on the other hand uses four different accordions that are titled to Education, Experience, Courses and Coding skill. Those accordions may have their own accordions inside depending on the information inside. Those accordions are shaped like card-element. Projects section has three different tabs named Python, Java and HTML projects. Each tab has two different example project with an openable image of the said project. The contact page on the other hand is pretty simple as it only shows the contact information such as email address or phone number.
